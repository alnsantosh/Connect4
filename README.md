# Connect4

This project was developed as a part of Machine Learning Project for CSCI 5622 under Prof. Chris Ketelsen. The project explore 2 different kind of Deep Reinforcement learning players. One which uses a Deep Nueral Network and another one uses a Structured Nueral Network.

## Code

The source code for the project can be found in the source folder. The Game Controller plays the game for both players. The game is made to plug and play any players. We just need to create a Game object with both player objects passed as parameters and the rest will be done by the controller.
